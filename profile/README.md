## ðŸš€ One big step to Open Source!

Since December 2024, **PTRE frontend is being rebuilt as an Open Source projet**, via this repository. [iiNSick](https://github.com/Jbaukens) is leading the front redesign, while [GeGe](https://github.com/GeGeGM) is reworking backend. For now, endpoints used by ingame tools wont change (might be reworked later on).

Details here: [PTRE Front](https://github.com/ogame-paye-ton-re/ptre-front).
